# Instructions To Start Game

## How To Start

From the battleship directory:

    1) Install all dependecies: npm install
    2) Start application: npm start
    3) Open in your browser by visiting https://localhost:3000/

## How To Run tests

From the battleship directory:

    1) Run tests: npm test

**Jest will launch in watch mode*. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, like how npm start recompiles the code.

The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run.
